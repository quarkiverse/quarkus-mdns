= mDNS

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

A Quarkus extension allowing use of Multicast DNS or `mDNS` to expose service advertisement as well as discover other services on your network.

mDNS is sometimes also called ZeroConf/Bonjour/Avahi/Rendezvous and can work in conjunction with DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), a companion zero-configuration networking technique specified separately in RFC 6763.

== Installation

If you want to use this extension, you need to add the `io.quarkiverse.mdns:quarkus-mdns` extension first to your build file.

For instance, with Maven, add the following dependency to your POM file:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.mdns</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-mdns</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Service Advertisement

`mDNS` by default will advertise your Quarkus server for HTTP discovery using the default application name.

All this is configurable, for example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0
quarkus.http.port=8081
quarkus.application.name=integration
----

Will expose your server on mDNS as `http://integration.local:8081` as an HTTP service type `_http._tcp.local.`.

IMPORTANT: `quarkus.http.host` must be set to `0.0.0.0` for the local URL `http://integration.local:8081` to work properly.  In dev/test mode this defaults to `localhost` which means the mDNS URL will not work.

Or you can inject it manually and expose any service you like. For example, this would expose it as supporting Apple TouchRemote on port 1024.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
JmDNS jmdns;

public void advertise() {
    Map<String, String> props = new HashMap<>();
    props.put("DvNm", "Quarkus Client");
    props.put("RemV", "10000");
    props.put("DvTy", "iPod");
    props.put("RemN", "Remote");
    props.put("txtvers", "1");
    ServiceInfo serviceInfo = ServiceInfo.create("_touch-remote._tcp", hostName, 1024, 0, 0, props);
    jmdns.registerService(serviceInfo);
}
----

== Service Discovery

You may also use `mDNS` to discover other services on your network by using the injectable component.  For example if you wanted to discover all the Apple Airport `_airport._tcp.local.` devices on your local network.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
JmDNS jmdns;

public void listServices() {
    ServiceInfo[] infos = jmdns.list("_airport._tcp.local.");
    for (ServiceInfo info : infos) {
        System.out.println(info);
    }
}
